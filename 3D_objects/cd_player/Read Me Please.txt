Please read me first:

Model is UV unwrapped with overlapping UVs


Model comes in 3 parts:

Flatparts        - use flat shading	
Smootparts1      - use smooth shading
Smoothparts2     - use smooth shading


For best results, the textures sets are:

Silver - use a shiney/ glossy material
Transparent  - combine a shiney with a transparent material
BlackPlasticTex - combine diffuse, glossy/shiney and provided texture
GreyPlasticTex  - combine diffuse, glossy/shiney and provided texture
Speaker Tex - Use provided texture
Screen Tex - Use provided texture
ShinyPlasticTex - combine diffuse, glossy/shiney and provided texture

Enjoy!
